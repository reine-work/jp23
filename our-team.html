                        <p>Josh is JazzyPay’s dedicated CEO, who is completely made up of pure experience and hard work. Having worked on countless software development projects for both local clients and abroad ever since he was a college student, his background
                            in tech became a significant stepping stone into his venture as an entrepreneur. Together with Kath, he co-founded his first venture into business with Tekibears Software Solutions, Inc., a company that provided software development
                            service and surveillance solutions to its clients. Despite the first company’s steady growth, Josh still chose to start JazzyPay and build it from the ground up, driven by the purpose to make a difference in the country’s current
                            financial infrastructure. As JazzyPay’s CEO, he leads the constant development of JazzyPay, but also makes time to personally communicate with both clients and employees. In his free time, you’ll most likely spot Josh out in
                            the peaceful wilderness, doing outdoor activities such as hiking, trekking, or just simply drinking in the wonders of nature.</p>

                        <p>“Knowing that we could make a difference by making effective payment solutions available to establishments that offer the most essential services, I just couldn’t ignore the idea of creating JazzyPay. We had a clear purpose for
                            this service that can help so many people, and that’s all the reason I needed to push through with JazzyPay. Everyday, I’m motivated to work because I know that we’re running towards a worthwhile cause.”

                        <p>Kath is JazzyPay’s fun-loving, positive, and driven COO and co-founder. Possessing a degree in culinary arts, her knowledge and experience in marketing fueled JazzyPay for take off. But even before establishing JazzyPay, Kath also
                            co-founded Tekibears Software Solutions, Inc. together with Joshua. Although Kath has experienced many ups and downs as a young, female entrepreneur, she only remains dedicated in continuing her journey as a businesswoman.
                            As the COO, Kath makes sure that she is directly involved in connecting with our partners and potential leads, because she never misses an opportunity to let them know that JazzyPay cares. If you can’t find Kath in the kitchen
                            whipping up treats for the team, she’s probably travelling and going on different adventures. </p>

                        <p>“With the sacrifices we had to make and the challenges we faced along the way, I can say that starting JazzyPay was definitely not an easy journey, but I knew from the very beginning that it was the right thing to do. I’m proud
                            of what we’ve achieved so far, and I’m excited to continue this journey for much longer together with a young, brilliant team that truly cares about achieving a meaningful goal.”</p>
