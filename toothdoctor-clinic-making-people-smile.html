                            <p><strong>Setting up your own business is never an easy task. From forming an idea to developing and transforming those intentions into action, there is no simple way to build a business from the ground up. Challenges are guaranteed along the way, and you will need unyielding dedication and effort added to your existing passion to overcome them. Thankfully, Dr. Maria Jasmin “Maj” Antonio-Mabeza, the woman behind ToothDoctor Dental Clinic, has all those values and never lost them over the years of establishing and developing her own business. We had the pleasure to interview her about her beginnings as a business owner and how she successfully manages to ensure her patients’ safety in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.</strong></p>
                            <hr>

                            <h3>Steady, unceasing growth</h3>

                            <p>Without a doubt, Dr. Maj has always been passionate about her job as a dentist. Despite having been urged by her parents to take up another course during her school years, she remained firm in choosing dentistry as her field
                                of study, and with hard work and perseverance, she successfully finished years of laborious work in dental school. Dr. Maj started as an associate dentist in 2006 for another clinic. She continued and deepened her venture
                                into the practice when she set up her first clinic in her very own home in order to lessen rental fees back in 2007. At that time, she juggled maintaining her position as an associate dentist for other clinics while also
                                managing her home clinic, which continued for another three years. Eventually, Dr. Maj decided to take another step for her career and quit her job as an associate dentist to open her first official clinic in 2011 and manage
                                it as the head dentist from then on.
                            </p>

                            <p>However, like many other people venturing into the world of business for the first time, Dr. Maj faced some challenges as she set up her first official clinic. As she started acquiring all the significant materials, machines,
                                and equipment for her dental clinic, she found herself struggling financially. Fortunately, her parents were there to support her and let her borrow money to fund the development of the clinic. With her loved ones’ helping
                                hand combined with her sheer dedication and determination for her business to grow, Dr. Maj slowly but surely gained more patients and even regulars who can attest to her excellent service. Because of the clinic’s constant
                                growth, Dr. Maj was able to pay off the loans she made and shortly gain from her business steadily. She also recalled the significance of her husband’s encouragement and faith in her and her craft, which played a big part
                                in spurring her to relocate the clinic to a bigger location in 2014 to its current spot today in <a href="https://jazzypay.com/merchant/BID-1194008">Ibayo, Marilao</a>.</p>

                            <p>In 2017, another major milestone was achieved as the second branch of ToothDoctor Clinic was opened in <a href="https://jazzypay.com/merchant/BID-1208063">Guiguinto, Bulacan</a>. Today, Dr. Maj has been practicing dentistry
                                for 14 years, with ToothDoctor Clinic operating for a whopping 9 years, a feat that is only possible because of Dr. Maj’s commitment and passion in making people smile.</p>

                            <h3>On overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic</h3>

                            <p>Like most businesses, Dr. Maj had to make some adjustments before she reopened her clinic in the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Although the clinic had to close during the first few months of lockdown, Dr. Maj took
                                it as an opportunity to make the clinic COVID-ready. First, she made sure that she invested in the necessary safety equipment before she resumed the operation of the clinic. A UV germicidal lamp has been installed in the
                                operation room, and chemical disinfection as well as steam sterilization are being conducted regularly to keep the space safe and free from the virus. The clinic also launched an appointment system for her patients, wherein
                                they now have to schedule and reserve a specific date and time for a consultation or operation. Additionally, the clinic is now only open 3 days a week, and work hours have also been cut short from 10am-7pm to 1pm-4pm.
                                The latter changes limit the patients that Dr. Maj can accommodate for each day, ultimately reducing the risk of spreading the virus and keeping her as well as her patients safe. As a front liner during these uncertain
                                times, worrying about everyone’s health cannot be helped. Despite this, however, Dr. Maj reminds fellow dentists, “Even during this outbreak, our patients deserve to have a healthy smile. You need to overcome your anxiety
                                and [ensure that you are observing] stringent protocols.”</p>

                            <h3>Ensuring safety with JazzyPay</h3>

                            <p>Due to the current pandemic, Dr. Maj has been relying on JazzyPay in receiving payments and is consistently encouraging her patients to go cashless now more than ever. She shares, “Even before the pandemic, JazzyPay has been
                                a great help to our clinic. Now, contactless payments [further ensure] the safety of both our staff and patients.” With JazzyPay, ToothDoctor Dental Clinic boosts their safety procedures by extending their precautionary
                                practices to their payment system, so your smile and health will never be compromised in their hands.</p>

                            <p>ToothDoctor Dental Clinic loves seeing their patients smile.
